Hello world.

This is a project i try in order to learn javascript for the first time.

It is supposed to be a booking form in which the user will be able to see what tables are available in a specific date, and book his desired table.

The final goal is to turn this into an actual wordpress plugin for personal use.

Does it look good? Absolutely not.
Do i know how to make WP plugins yet? No...

Wish me luck.

ps. Any tips are welcome.
